# Parcels

####  Write a program for parcels with post. September 11, 2018

#### By **Vera Weikel & Derek Smith**

## Description
Create a website where the user can submit a form with the dimensions and weight of a Parcel, and you can use the data in the form to instantiate a Parcel object and display its dimensions and weight

### Specs
Create a Parcel class. Be sure that your Parcel class has a constructor as well as getters and setters for each property. All properties should be set to private. You should be able to create a new parcel and specify the dimensions and weight in the arguments.
Create a website where the user can submit a form with the dimensions and weight of a Parcel, and you can use the data in the form to instantiate a Parcel object and display its dimensions and weight.
When you call a method called Volume() on a Parcel instance, it should return the product of the sides.
When you call a CostToShip() method on your parcel, return a cost based on a formula you make up.
Display the cost to ship and the volume of a Parcel with its dimensions in your site.
Add validation: Make sure that the Parcel object is not created if any of the form fields are blank. Display an error message instead. Also remember to make sure that your user can only enter numbers into the form.
